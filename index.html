      "Retrograde" is a book that contains the life hacking formula of Otaku Peasants 
      who realized an automatic monthly income of 100 million won. 
      They completed their own 'Retrograde 7-step' theory through trial and error. 
      This book not only discusses theories on making money but also provides concrete methods.

      <li>
        "After reading 'Retrograde,' I decided to study economics. 
        I decided to believe and follow Jacheong's words 
        that you can become a quasi-expert by reading 10-20 related books."
